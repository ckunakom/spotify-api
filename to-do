Leave no stones unturned:

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-album
- Get the album image and genre from the following (throw a loop like artists.py or something)
- Will need album id from top_tracks 
- Response data: id, images (maybe same quality from top_tracks, but get it anyway since already there), 
genre, album_type, total_tracks, external_urls, release_date

Oh god... update data cleaning too.
- Will have to redo the pd.merge to not use the artist....or do i...?
- Currently genre is associated with just artists not tracks. So if the track is in different genre, it still uses genre based on the artist.
- Use album genre since that's what the track is associated with and will be more accurate when doing stats on top genres.
- Go figure it out how to replace artist genre with album genre!

Would love it if tableau doesn't need to be updated.....
